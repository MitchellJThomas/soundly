## Usage

### Recording Audio

```java
// Record 10 seconds of audio to test.mp3
AudioProcessor.recordFromMicrophone("test.mp3", 10);
```

### Processing Audio Files

```java
// Process an audio file with moving average
List<Double> processedSamples = AudioProcessor.movingAverage(audioSamples, 100);
```
